# Joining Discord for Quantum Wednesday Talks

> [!NOTE]
> Quantum Wednesday Talks are now hosted on Zoom, but we still maintain the #quantum-wednesday Discord channel for discussion.
Welcome!

If you're presenting at our **Quantum Wednesday** group meeting, you likely want to join the [Unitary Foundation Discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation).
If you're unfamiliar, [Discord](https://discord.com/) is a platform that combines text, voice, and video chat.

## Speaking at QW: TL;DR (For Those in a Hurry)

- ✅ **Join** [our Discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation) **at least 10 minutes before your talk** (preferably a day before). This is a requirement, not a suggestion! If you do not join early, Discord will think you're a spammer and restrict your ability to speak.
- ✅ **Find the right channels**: **📚〢quantum-wednesday** (for discussion).
- ✅ **Join Zoom** the link will be on the event calendar invite. Join a few minutes prior to the session starting.

## 5️⃣ Etiquette

- Keep discussions **focused on Quantum Wednesday** in **📚〢quantum-wednesday**.
- When you're not speaking, please **mute yourself** to reduce background noise (noise detection and suppression is not as good on Discord as it is on other platforms).
- **Respect others** and their opinions. We're here to learn and share knowledge.

## 6️⃣ After Your Talk

Well done!
Thank you for sharing your knowledge with the community.

- Share your slides or any other resources in **📚〢quantum-wednesday** channel.
- Feel free to share your talk on social media and tag us [@unitary.foundation](https://bsky.app/profile/unitary.foundation) on Bluesky.
- If you have any feedback or suggestions, please share them with someone on the UF team!

Need help? Ask in **📚〢quantum-wednesday** or reach out to one of the moderators.
