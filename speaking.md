# Joining Discord for Quantum Wednesday Talks

Welcome!
If you're presenting at our **Quantum Wednesday** group meeting, you'll need to join the [Unitary Foundation Discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation) to give your talk.

If you're unfamiliar, [Discord](https://discord.com/) is a platform that combines text, voice, and video chat.
Think Zoom combined with \*insert your favorite chat app\*.
Quantum Wednesday is an open-to-all journal club where anyone interested can join.

## Speaking at QW: TL;DR (For Those in a Hurry)

- ✅ **Join** [our Discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation) **at least 10 minutes before your talk** (preferably a day before). This is a requirement, not a suggestion! If you do not join early, Discord will think you're a spammer and restrict your ability to speak.
- ✅ **Find the right channels**: **📞〢community-call** (for the talk) & **📚〢quantum-wednesday** (for discussion).
- ✅ **Test screen sharing** in advance if needed ([Discord docs here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share)).

Below is a more thorough walkthrough of the process.

## 1️⃣ Joining the Discord Server

1. Visit http://discord.unitary.foundation.
2. Follow the prompts to create an account (if you don't have one).
3. **Join at least 10 minutes before your talk** — this is required before you can speak in voice channels due to Discord's spam/bot detection measures. Ideally join the server a day before your talk to familiarize yourself with the platform, especially if you haven't used Discord before.
4. Complete the intro walkthrough inside Discord, which includes introducing yourself in **👋〢introduce-yourself**.

## 2️⃣ Finding the Right Channels

Once inside, the two most important channels for QW are:
- **📞〢community-call** – This is the voice channel where the talk happens.
- **📚〢quantum-wednesday** – This text channel is for discussion related to Quantum Wednesday.

## 3️⃣ Presenting & Screen Sharing

If you plan to share slides or code, you'll need to use Discord's screen sharing feature:
1. Click **📞〢community-call** to join the voice channel (your webcam video will be off by default).
2. Click the **Share Your Screen** button (usually a monitor icon) and follow the instructions through Discord. Discord's documentation on the topic can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share).

## 4️⃣ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

🔹 **Can't speak in the voice channel?**
- You likely joined less than 10 minutes ago. Unfortunately, this restriction is automatic. There's nothing to do besides wait for the timeout to end.

🔹 **Can't hear others?**
- Audio related issues are usually due to your device settings. Check your audio output settings in Discord and your system settings. Discord's troubleshooting docs [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138471-Discord-Voice-and-Video-Troubleshooting-Guide).

🔹 **Screen sharing isn't working?**
- Make sure Discord has permission to record your screen (Mac users may need to adjust security settings).
- Restart Discord and try again.

## 5️⃣ Discord Etiquette

- Keep discussions **focused on Quantum Wednesday** in **📚〢quantum-wednesday**.
- When you're not speaking, please **mute yourself** to reduce background noise (noise detection and suppression is not as good on Discord as it is on other platforms).
- **Respect others** and their opinions. We're here to learn and share knowledge.

## 6️⃣ After Your Talk

Well done!
Thank you for sharing your knowledge with the community.

- Share your slides or any other resources in **📚〢quantum-wednesday** channel.
- Feel free to share your talk on social media and tag us [@unitary.foundation](https://bsky.app/profile/unitaryfoundation.bsky.social) on Bluesky.
- If you have any feedback or suggestions, please share them with someone on the UF team!
