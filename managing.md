# Quantum Wednesday Managing

A QW manager is mainly responsible for finding speakers/filling slots, but there are a few other minor tasks alongside this role.

- Find speakers! Doesn't have to be external, and doesn't have to be a formal talk. Can be a focused discussion, watch party, social coding, etc.
- A day before the event, send both email (to `all@unitary.fund`, and in special cases `community@unitary.fund`) and Discord message (in `#general`) to community to ensure people know event is happening. On discord, you can share the event.
  - To garner further interest, send an email the Friday before to give people time to prepare.
- Ensure speakers slides are uploaded to our shared Google drive in the [Quantum Wednesday](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZpHoh2BFf0QpV6E_VvAZa4P0TzTTT_lF?usp=sharing) directory
- If video was recorded, upload to the drive.
- Send message on Discord with links to the slides and recording, thanking the speaker.
