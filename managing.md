# Quantum Wednesday Managing

A QW manager is mainly responsible for finding speakers/filling slots, but there are a few other minor tasks alongside this role.

- Find speakers! Doesn't have to be external, and doesn't have to be a formal talk. Can be a focused discussion, watch party, social coding, etc.
- Ensure the appropriate discord events are made. This requires creating a new QW banner which is easily created, and exported from [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/M0d4rzPOTXMfeQT4K18OGB/UF-Social?node-id=1211-15&t=TN65m8kOoAvo8I9j-0).
- In the days before the event, send a message to the `#journal-club` channel on Discord with a link to the discord event as well as the paper/topic the speaker will be presenting on. Ensure there are no overlaps with other community meetings. If there are, ensure they are in separate rooms.
  - To garner further interest, send an email to `all@unitary.fund`, and in special cases `community@unitary.fund` to ensure people know event is happening.
- Ensure speakers slides are uploaded to our shared Google drive in the [Quantum Wednesday](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZpHoh2BFf0QpV6E_VvAZa4P0TzTTT_lF?usp=sharing) directory.
- If video was recorded, upload to the drive.
- Send message on Discord with links to the slides and recording, thanking the speaker.
- Keep the table in the README up to date with the related links/info.
